Savita Manchanda - Portfolio

## Description

I made this Portfolio so that I can showcase skill and talents to potentional employers. This portfolio was made using only HTML and CSS. I have added a CSS Snippet Cheatsheet that I made as a mini-project during my bootcamp. I will be adding more deployed applications as I finish them.
